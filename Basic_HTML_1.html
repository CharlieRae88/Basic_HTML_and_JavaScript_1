<p><i><font color="orange" face="Arial" size="2">when you love someone you open yourself up to suffering. 
That's the sad truth. 
Maybe they'll break your heart, maybe you'll break their heart and never be able to look at yourself in the same way.</font></i></p>

<p><u><font color= "#4A235A" face=" Comic Sans" size="4">Those are the risks, that's the burden. 
Like wings, they have weight, we feel that weight. 
We feel that weight on our back, but they are a burden that lifts us. 
Burdens that allow us to fly.</font></u></p>
